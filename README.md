# Measuring Access to Pharmacy Services (maps)
To address the issue of pharmacy deserts, a new community pharmacy has been established in Avondale, Cincinnati, Ohio—an area previously lacking adequate pharmacy access.
The overall goal of this project is to evaluate the impact of eliminating the pharmacy desert in Avondale on patients’ health outcomes.

Specific Objectives
===================
1.	Characterize Patients: Describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of Avondale patients with chronic diseases who receive care within the UC Health system.
2.	Pharmacy Access and Use: Assess how far Avondale patients travel to their preferred pharmacies, particularly when these pharmacies are not the new independent community pharmacy located near UC Health (Its name is , “Altev” community pharmacy).
3.	Healthcare Utilization: Evaluate patterns of healthcare utilization among UC Health patients who use pharmacies located in Avondale



Methodology
